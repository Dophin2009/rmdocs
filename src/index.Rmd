# What is LaTeX?

LaTeX is a document typsetting language and build system based off TeX

-   Turing-complete
-   Powerful control over formatting
-   Define commands and macros
-   Automate citations

# Installing TeX

TeX comes in many different distributions

-   **TeX Live**: the distribution of choice for most \*nix distributions
    -   Packages available for most Linux distributions
-   **MiKTeX**: maintained for Windows; has a Windows installer
-   **MacTeX**: like TeX Live, but more compatibility with OS X

Full installation might be up to ~6 GB

# Creating a LaTeX Document {.noscroll}

Here's an example LaTeX document: 


```{.latex include=docs/example-latex.tex}
```

# Breaking It Down

`\documentclass[options]{class}` defines the layout standard

-   `options` can set main font size, paper size, and column structure
-   `class` defines standard layout; can be `article`, `report`, `book`, 
    `letter`, `beamer`, etc.

`\usepackage[options]{pkgname}` imports a TeX package and exposes it commands
for use

----

## Document

`\begin{blockname}` begins some block of text and commands

-   `blockname` may be associated with some command or custom definition
-   `\begin{document}` defines where the document actually begins
-   `\begin{titlepage}` declares a page dedicated to the title

`\end{blockname}` ends a block

`\section` defines a new section/chapter/etc. block

## Commands

`\textbf` makes text bold; `\textit` makes text italicized

Changing text size: 

-   `\small` makes text small; `\Large`, well, large
-   Some other basic font differences, such as `\large` and `\Huge`

`\blindtext`, provided by the `blindtext` package, produces filler text

These are just a couple basic ones, there are many, many more provided by the
core library and packages

# Making It Useful

There are a number of TeX compilers that should be included in standard TeX
installations.

-   **`latex`** - generates a DVI document, but supports only `.eps` and `.ps` 
    image formats
-   **`pdflatex`** - generates a PDF document; supports `.png`, `.jpg`, and
    `.pdf` image formats
-   **`xelatex`** - like `pdflatex`, but with robust Unicode and font support
-   **`lualatex`** - like `xelatex`, but can embed Lua code

```shell
> xelatex example-latex.tex     # produces example-latex.pdf
```

![](docs/example-latex-1.png){width=80%}

# Increasing Complexity

Here's a slightly more complicated example:

```{.latex include=docs/example-twocolumn.tex}
```

```shell
> tree --dirsfirst --charset=ascii -n .
  .
  |-- example-twocolumn.tex
  `-- xkcd-file-ext.png
```

----

```shell
> xelatex example-twocolumn.tex   # produces example-twocolumn.tex
```

![](docs/example-twocolumn-1.png){width=60%}

# Toning Back the Complexity

Sometimes you might not need that much control or complexity
