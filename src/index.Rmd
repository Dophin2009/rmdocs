# What is LaTeX?

LaTeX is a document typsetting language and build system based off TeX

-   Turing-complete
-   Powerful control over formatting
-   Define commands and macros
-   Automate citations


# Installing TeX

TeX comes in many different distributions

-   **TeX Live**: the distribution of choice for most \*nix distributions
    -   Packages available for most Linux distributions
-   **MiKTeX**: maintained for Windows; has a Windows installer
-   **MacTeX**: like TeX Live, but more compatibility with OS X

Full installation might be up to ~6 GB


# Creating a LaTeX Document {.noscroll}

Here's an example LaTeX document:


```{.latex include=docs/example-latex.tex}
```


# Breaking It Down

`\documentclass[options]{class}` defines the layout standard

-   `options` can set main font size, paper size, and column structure
-   `class` defines standard layout; can be `article`, `report`, `book`,
    `letter`, `beamer`, etc.

`\usepackage[options]{pkgname}` imports a TeX package and exposes it commands
for use

## Document

`\begin{blockname}` begins some block of text and commands

-   `blockname` may be associated with some command or custom definition
-   `\begin{document}` defines where the document actually begins
-   `\begin{titlepage}` declares a page dedicated to the title

`\end{blockname}` ends a block

`\section` defines a new section/chapter/etc. block

## Commands

`\textbf` makes text bold; `\textit` makes text italicized

Changing text size:

-   `\small` makes text small; `\Large`, well, large
-   Some other basic font differences, such as `\large` and `\Huge`

`\blindtext`, provided by the `blindtext` package, produces filler text

These are just a couple basic ones, there are many, many more provided by the
core library and packages


# Making It Useful

There are a number of TeX compilers that should be included in standard TeX
installations.

-   **`latex`** - generates a DVI document, but supports only `.eps` and `.ps`
    image formats
-   **`pdflatex`** - generates a PDF document; supports `.png`, `.jpg`, and
    `.pdf` image formats
-   **`xelatex`** - like `pdflatex`, but with robust Unicode and font support
-   **`lualatex`** - like `xelatex`, but can embed Lua code

```{bash, results = 'hide'}
cd docs
xelatex example-latex.tex     # produces example-latex.pdf
```

```{bash, echo = FALSE}
cd docs
pdftoppm "example-latex.pdf" "example-latex" -png
```

![](docs/example-latex-1.png){width=80%}


# Increasing Complexity

Here's a slightly more complicated example:

```{.latex include=docs/example-twocolumn.tex}
```

```shell
> tree --dirsfirst --charset=ascii -n docs
  .
  |-- example-twocolumn.tex
  `-- xkcd-file-ext.png
```

----

```{bash, results = 'hide'}
cd docs
xelatex example-twocolumn.tex   # produces example-twocolumn.tex
```

```{bash, echo = FALSE}
cd docs
pdftoppm "example-twocolumn.pdf" "example-twocolumn" -png
```

![](docs/example-twocolumn-1.png){width=60%}


# Citations with BibTeX

BibTeX is a citation data format (`.bib` files) useful for generating automatic
citations

-   Many, many different citation types (full list
    [bibtex.com/e/entry-types](https://www.bibtex.com/e/entry-types))
-   Use any bibliography style (with a `.csl` file)

Some citations from my statistics midterm project:

```{.bib include=docs/example-bib.bib}
```

# Citing in LaTeX with BibLaTeX

Citations can be autogenerated with the `biblatex` package:

```{.latex include=docs/example-bib.tex}
```

----

```{bash, results = 'hide'}
cd docs
xelatex example-bib.tex
biber example-bib
xelatex example-bib.tex
xelatex example-bib.tex
```

```{bash, echo = FALSE}
cd docs
pdftoppm "example-bib.pdf" "example-bib" -png
```

# Toning Down the Complexity

Sometimes you might not need that much control or complexity

-   Too many commands
-   Document setup is too complicated
-   Only need basic document or predefined document templates


# Markdown

A simple markup language for writing documents that require simple formatting

-   Used almost universally in README files
    -   GitHub has its own flavor: GitHub-Flavored Markdown
-   Comes in many different flavors; depends on the parser
-   Many parsers to transform markdown into HTML, PDF, DVI, etc.


# Example

Very basic syntax that should be unviersal across most markdown processors

```{.markdown include=docs/example-markdown.md}
```

Things like tables usually differ across processors; some support, some don't,
syntax might be different


# Rendering

There are many, many implementations of markdown, mostly targeting HTML:

-   **Markdown.pl**: the original, not updated since 2004 --
    [daringfireball.net/projects/markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
-   **CommonMark**: an attempt at a standard --
    [commonmark.org](https://commonmark.org/)
-   **PHP Markdown**: PHP port of the original --
    [github.com/michelf/php-markdown](https://github.com/michelf/php-markdown)
-   **Marked**: Javascript implementation --
    [marked.js.org](https://marked.js.org/)
-   **MultiMarkdown**: another implementation --
    [fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-6](https://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-6/)
-   Python-Markdown, Maraku, kramdown, Parsedown, showdown, etc

# Pandoc

Pandoc ([pandoc.org](https://pandoc.org/)) is a universal markup converter

-   Convert to and from tons of markup formats (see
    [conversion diagram](https://pandoc.org/diagram.jpg))
-   Has its own markdown flavor


# Using Pandoc

We can use Pandoc to convert our markdown into HTML:

```{bash, results = 'hide'}
cd docs
pandoc -s example-markdown.md -o example-markdown.html
```


# Converting to TeX

We can convert it to TeX and perhaps modify it:

```{bash, results = 'hide'}
cd docs
pandoc example-markdown.md -o example-markdown.tex
```

```{.tex include=docs/example-markdown.tex}
```


# Converting to PDF

We can convert it to PDF:

```{bash, results = 'hide'}
cd docs
pandoc example-markdown.md -o example-markdown.pdf
```

```{bash, echo = FALSE}
cd docs
pdftoppm "example-markdown.pdf" "example-markdown" -png
```
